Gold Seal,John Wilson,8''-11'',"The Gold Seal won more Olympic medals than any other model at PyeongChang 2018. Coincidence? We think not. Perhaps the most widely recommended blade by Russian coaches, this blade delivers for freestyle and pairs skaters seeking an optimal spinning experience. Due to its higher heel stanchion, unique compound radius and tapered/hollow ground features, skaters report experiencing effortless spins and control in their footwork sequences and edge jumps. Trusted and worn by Evgenia Medvedeva.",10700000
Pattern 99,John Wilson,8''-11'',"The Pattern 99 blade is no stranger to the podium. It is one of the most popular profiles in the world as it consistently delivers maximum performance to high-end freestyle skaters.

This blade is ‘the real McCoy’ – it’s not comparable to anything, it’s not similar to anything, it’s the original.
