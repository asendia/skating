Perhaps the most widely recommended blade by Russian coaches, this blade delivers for freestyle and pairs skaters seeking an optimal spinning experience.

Trusted and worn by Evgenia Medvedeva.",10700000

This blade is ‘the real McCoy’ – it’s not comparable to anything, it’s not similar to anything, it’s the original. If you’re emerging as an elite level skater with powerful jumps and seek more control by being lower to the ice, this blade is undoubtedly your best option in our range.",10700000

If you are leaving a boot/blade combination set and plan on developing your axel and double jumps, this is our recommended option.",5500000
Coronation Dance,John Wilson,8''-11'',The Coronation Dance is John Wilson’s premier dance and synchronized skating option.

It also features our new ‘Tuff’ plate design which is lighter and 2X as strong as traditional options.",6100000
Dance,MK,8''-12'',"When it comes to dance blades, look no further than the podiums to make an educated decision. At Pyeongchang 2018, 85% of allOlympic Ice Dance athletes used the MK Dance for its slimline design, allowing the skater to move from one edge to the other much quicker.
